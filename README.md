Detection of Multiclass Objects in Optical Remote Sensing Images [GRSL paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8573851)  
# Running Environments:
Ubuntu 16.04
Anaconda([Anaconda3-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64 python 3.6](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux))   
torch 0.4.0a  [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#from-source)  
torchvision [Vision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision)
  
  
# Prerequisites
```python
  pip install shapely  
``` 
Download weight parameters form [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pvsVnxh4fqhkiInegHLlqunLvCHJENz8/view?usp=sharing) and put it into backup file folder.  
Download [DOTA](https://captain-whu.github.io/DOTA/index.html) dataset  
  
Note: Please config the improved orientated response network follows [IORN](https://github.com/wdczs/ImprovedORN)

# Test:  
```python
  python detect.py  
```
# Train:  

```
  All training images of task 2 are divided into 1024Ã—1024 pixel patches by the DOTA development kit  
```
```
  You can delete the patches which contain no object. Generate train list of all divided images like "train_img_example/train.txt"   
```
```
  Change train list path in "cfg/dota.data"  
```
```python
  python train.py cfg/dota.data cfg/orn_4_dota.cfg backup/000057.weights  
```

# Evaluate for DOTA testset or valset:  
```python
  Generate test image list like "test_img/test_img_list.txt"  
```
```python
  Run "python test_for_map.py"
```
